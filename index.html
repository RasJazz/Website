            <h1>GameDevScript</h1>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p class="text-left">GameDevScript, or GDS for short, is a DSL for game development. 
                        It is an Object-Oriented Programming language inspired by C# and Python that uses a more simplified syntax in order to 
                        make programming easier for both experienced game devs and people who have never seen a line of code before. 
                        With the demand for games growing, having a programming language that makes writability simpler can make game development 
                        time quicker versus spending time trying to work with more verbose languages such as C++. 
                        It is also designed with modularity in mind which is crucial when working on multiple teams. 
                        Finally, it works on a similar concept to Unity's Scriptable Objects.

            <h1>Ecosystem</h1>
                <p><b>Potential development tools and library ecosystem</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Environment that supports assets with drag and drop elements
                        <ul>
                        <li>ex. attaching modules to game assets, attaching objects that interact with each other to objects</li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Blueprint system allowing connectivity of assets
                        <ul>
                        <li>Game development environments such as Unity and Unreal allow for similar modularity, but it can become overwhelming keeping track of modules</li>
